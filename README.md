# F1-Race-Analysis
Max vs Lewis (EDA with Python)
# 1. Executive Summary:
This project compares the performance of Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton for F1 seasons (2010-2020). Csv data files were created with Chatgpt, which includes lap times, pit stops and race metadata. Multiple visualization are done to analyse races between 2 drivers (who had the fastest lap, better pit stop startegy)
#    Problem:
Crucial insights are hidden in pit stop strategies that influences race times for the drivers
#    Solution:
Examined performances for both drivers from 2010-2020 for Exploratory Data Analysis to show which driver performed better over a period of 11 seasons
#    Impact:
Analysis highlights key factors which influences the outcome of the race, like pit-stop frequency, fastest laps, and average pace. It provides a clear framework to examine a driver's performance
# 2. Methodology:
#    Data generation:
Created CSV files for race metadata (races, pit stops lap time) 
#    Data cleaning:
Uploaded the datsets using Pandas, also merged lap time with pit stops for better analysis
#    Visualization:
Calculated average lap times, fastest laps and pit stop counts (used graphs like bar chart, pie chart, box plot, stacked bar)
# 3. Skills:
#    Python:
Pandas for data loading, cleanin, merging,
Matplotlib for graphs,
Numpy for random number generation for data files
# 4. Results:
Lap time trends: Average lap time was different each year, those differnces were vital to win races
Pit stops: Duration of stops affected overall performance
Strategy: Pit stop timing was a common startegy that helped driver to win races
# 5. Next steps: 
Maybe tire strategy analysis for future, dashboard creation, inclusion of more drivers
